Website revamp proposal

George,

We really like what you have already put together on your site.  The page look and feel really does show the experience that you and your staff have in this field.  Having a background in fitness myself as a CPT I believe that I can really help you make the needed changes to help your business grow even larger while maintaining your current client base through added value.  Here is what I believe we should do based on your suggestions.

Making changes to your site is a great step in improving your signup rate and client retention.  A new marketing plan which should include direct mail marketing to the area and a cohesive approach with your monthly emails and newsletter is also suggested.  By taking advantage of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) you will see an increase in site traffic so all marketing materials should have the same look and feel while showing the warm invitation of your safe and proven fitness environment!  We will use your list of keywords:  Portland gym, health club, weight loss, personal trainer, fitness center,

I like your “call to action” boxes that rotate through on the homepage, but feel that the “action points” need to be accented more.  The slide rate needs to be slowed down and content left minimal unless the visitors click on a “read more” type button.  This would keep your customer on your site longer by giving them needed information more quickly. Often memberships are spontaneous decisions made when one feels insecure about their current conditioning or health.  Perhaps fitness statistics should be flipped through and the “sales portions” should just be static elements like they are at the bottom of the page?  The perception that your clients should have is that this journey, though hard, is very realistic and you will make it as easy as possible.  24 hour access needs to stand out.  7 day “trial” membership needs to also stand out!  I’d like to place 2 visible clickable buttons for these two points.

Since Activtrax is proprietary it might make sense to “define” it more clearly with a short catch phrase like “your personal training assistance program”.  This will help encourage clients by showing them that they are not alone in their process.

Your sliding testimonials should have forward and backward navigation to enable a reader to better access a particular quote and share with others what they just read.  These are here to assist in the sales process.  I would decrease the font size and darken it a bit

Since Hollywood Fitness has been locally owned for 30 years I would like to include a “badge” on the hopepage which reflects that accomplishment.  Gyms are very expensive to operate as you know and close as quickly as they open their doors.  Your clientele should feel safe in signing up for your business and know that the money that they have given you in advance and will continue to pay monthly is the best investment that they have ever made.

Members should be able to login to the page for information about themselves, current gym events, changes in policy or staff, etc.  I think your site should also show its community and support that is available to each member.   Your idea of an improved referral or reward program could be under a “My Tab” section when a client logs in?  This could be a “locker”, “locker-room”, “lounge”, or something else catchy.  This information, though mentioned on the homepage should only be accessible to members.  This would require a dummy or mock-up page.  

These are going to be great changes and look forward to showing you the first round of comps!
